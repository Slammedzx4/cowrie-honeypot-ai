The AI script:

Reads cowrie.json
Finds recent source IPs
Shows their credentials and commands
Optionally calls Ollama + Gemma to describe behavior in one sentence

1. Create the script (see analysis/ai.sh in this repo)

On the honeypot VM as cowrie do these commands:
sudo su - cowrie
mkdir -p ~/analysis
# copy analysis/ai.sh from this repo into /home/cowrie/analysis/ai.sh


Make it executable:
cd ~/analysis
chmod +x ai.sh

2. (Optional) Install Ollama + Gemma on honeypot VM

If your VM has enough resources:

curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
ollama pull gemma2:2b


If you skip this, the script still prints IPs / creds / commands; 
the AI line will just say that Ollama isn’t installed.
