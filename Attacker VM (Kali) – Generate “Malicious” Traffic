On Kali (replace IPs if different):

# simulate multiple password guesses (brute-force style)
ssh root@10.0.2.15 -p 2222
# try several wrong passwords like: password, 123456, 12345, etc.
# Ctrl+C or disconnect and repeat a few times

# once you know a working password (from past logs), act like an attacker
ssh root@10.0.2.15 -p 2222
# password: <one that Cowrie accepts>

ls
uname -a
cat /etc/passwd
exit


All of this is logged by Cowrie in cowrie.json.
